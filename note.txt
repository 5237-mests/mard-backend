I want to create a service `storeReceiveService.ts` for managing store receiving in my multi-store inventory system. 
I already have a `StoreItemService` that handles adding/updating store items quantity. 
The new service should handle the following:

1. **Roles:** RECEIVER creates and edits pending receives. STOREKEEPER approves or rejects receives.
2. **Tables:** 
   - `store_receives` (id, store_id, reference_no, status ENUM('pending','approved','rejected'), created_by_id, approved_by_id, created_at, approved_at)
   - `store_receive_items` (id, receive_id, item_id, quantity, cost_price, note)
3. **Flow:**
   - RECEIVER creates a receive (status='pending')
   - RECEIVER adds multiple items to the receive
   - RECEIVER can edit receive or its items before approval
   - STOREKEEPER approves the receive → increase store_items quantity using `StoreItemService.addMultiplestoreItems` 
   - STOREKEEPER can reject the receive → status='rejected', inventory unchanged
4. **Transactions:** Ensure database operations are transactional where needed.
5. **Validation:** 
   - Check store exists
   - Check item exists
   - Quantity must be positive integer
   - Cannot approve empty receive
6. **Return values:** 
   - For createReceive → return receive id
   - For getReceiveById → return receive + items + user info
   - For approveReceive → return true/false
7. **Additional features:** 
   - Filtering receives by status, store, date range
   - Pagination for listing receives
   - Editing pending receives only
